### OlÃ¡ / Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo Nunes, I'm 23 years old and I'm Brazilian. At the beginning of my career, I am looking for an internship opportunity for web programmer in companies that are recruiting candidates willing to learn, share new knowledge and contribute to their success in the market.

I have no professional experience, but I can demonstrate my experience in programming through my GitHub, in which I am always posting content through projects using knowledge acquired in programming using frameworks and libraries that are on the market.

I am a technology lover, especially in the field of programming. In the various areas that programming allows you to work in, I am very interested in web programming, both Frontend and Backend, in which I feel more motivated and interested to always be acquiring new knowledge.

If you have any doubt hope I can help you!
