### OlÃ¡ / Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo Nunes and I'm 23 years old. I am a technology lover, especially in the field of programming and systems development, specializing in web development. I am studying the 5th semester of computer science at Centro UniversitÃ¡rio IESB - BrasÃ­lia DF.

I am looking for a programmer position in the market, so far I have no professional experience but I can demonstrate my experience in programming through the following repositories, in which I am whenever possible posting projects that are made using knowledge acquired in programming.

If you have any questions I hope I can help you!
